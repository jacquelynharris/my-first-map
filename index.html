                    <p class="copy">Senior citizens shuffle from table to table in the Riverbank Park Cultural Center, collecting literature from agency tables like the Legal Aid Society and the New York City Department of Ageing. They sit in folded chairs and chat in the large, gymnasium-like space. The “Senior Housing Conference and Resource Fair,”has a fairly large crowd for a Monday morning.
                    </p>
                    <p> Nidao Safi, 79, goes up to the mic for the Q&A panel, and vents his frustration to a panel of housing experts. He’s lived in the same apartment since 1968. He’s been in and out of Housing Court for the last four years and has filed complaints with the city and the state’s housing departments about persistent mold and other violations in his apartment, but he’s still not seeing the repairs he needs.
                    </p>
                    <p> “I’m nearly 80 years old so this is becoming a little rocky for me,” Safi says. “And if it wasn’t for my faith when I need God and the meditation I do, I’d be going cuckoo.”

                        }();
                        </script>
                        <p>The conference is organized by Assemblyman Al Taylor’s office to connect Harlem’s senior citizens with housing resources and programs they may not be aware of. However, as Mr. Safi points out, even when the resources are supposedly there, it’s hard to know where to turn to.
